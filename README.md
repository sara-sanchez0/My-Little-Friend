Each pet has their own header and cpp files for their unique responses and stat changes. The goal of the game is to take care of the pets and train them to compete to win the game, 
with the duck requiring a bit of luck to win! I created this project at the time of my C++ Intro to Programming class, where I learned how to write functions, read from and write to files, 
use more than one cpp file, and more, all of which I used in this project.
